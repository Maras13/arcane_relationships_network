# 🌌 Arcane Relationship Visualization 🎬

This project creates an interactive network visualization of characters from the animated series *Arcane*, showcasing their relationships (alliances, rivalries, etc.). The visualization is available in two versions:

1. **Python Version** 🐍: Using the Pyvis library for easy creation and export of interactive network visualizations.
2. **JavaScript Version** 🌐: Using D3.js for creating a custom, interactive web visualization.

Both versions display the relationships between key characters from *Arcane*, with nodes representing characters and edges representing relationships.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Graph** 🔄: Explore character relationships in an interactive network format.
- **Color-Coded Nodes** 🎨: Nodes are color-coded by the character's role (Hero, Villain, Mentor, etc.).
- **Dynamic Layout** 🌟: The graph uses force-directed layouts to automatically arrange nodes and links.
- **Labels** 🏷️: Each node has a label showing the character’s name and role.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python (Pyvis)** 🐍: Used for generating an interactive HTML visualization of the network graph.
- **JavaScript (D3.js)** 🌐: Provides a customizable, interactive web visualization of the network.
- **HTML/CSS** 💻: Used for structuring and styling the D3.js-based web visualization.
